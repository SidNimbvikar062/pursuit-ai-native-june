# AI Native Journey

## Description
AI Native Journey is an exploration into building applications and systems that are fundamentally designed to leverage artificial intelligence. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing AI-native architectures, focusing on cutting-edge concepts like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI agents, multimodal models, and seamless integration with various AI APIs.

## Features/Key Concepts
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implementation of advanced RAG systems for enhanced AI responses
- **AI Agents**: Development of autonomous agents capable of complex task execution
- **Multimodal Models**: Integration of models that can process and generate multiple types of data (text, images, audio)
- **API Integration**: Seamless connection with various AI service providers
- **Custom AI Workflows**: Building end-to-end AI-powered applications
- **Best Practices**: Implementation of AI-native design patterns and architectures

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **AI Frameworks & Libraries**:
  - LangChain
  - Hugging Face Transformers
  - OpenAI API
  - Anthropic Claude API
  - Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
  - PyTorch/TensorFlow
- **Development Tools**:
  - Git
  - Docker
  - Poetry/Pip
  - Jupyter Notebooks

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Native_Journey.git
   cd AI_Native_Journey
   ```

2. Set up your environment:
   ```bash

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```
