# 1. Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable
user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# 2. (Optional) You can still have a topic if you like, or remove it.
#    Let's keep it for now for consistency with your printf idea.

# 3. Print a greeting that uses the name variable
print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to {topic_string}.")

# Example of how you might have stored a fixed name before (now replaced by user input)
# fixed_name = "Alice"
# print(f"Hello, {fixed_name}! This is a fixed greeting.")
